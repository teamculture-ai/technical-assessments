# Technical Assessment: Student Academic Analytics System

Welcome to the technical assessment for the Student Academic Analytics System. This assessment aims to evaluate your skills in front-end development, back-end development, and database design. Please carefully review the requirements and instructions before proceeding.

## Requirements:

1. Develop a responsive web page for teachers to input students' academic results, including student name, subject, score and feedbacks. This data should be submitted to the backend via APIs.
2. Implement a bar chart to display the average score for each subject, allowing teachers to visualize the data.
3. Analyse the feedbacks of all the students and generate some meaningful insights from the feedbacks.
4. Ensure an easy-to-use UI/UX for both data input and data visualization.
5. Design and implement the necessary APIs for the front-end to interact with the backend.
6. Create an appropriate database schema to store the academic results.

## Hints:

1. You are free to use any programming language and frameworks to complete the assessment.
2. If you want to showcase your proficiency with our preferred tech stacks, you can use the following:
  - Language: Typescript
  - Front-End: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
  - Back-End: Nest.js + PostgreSQL + Prisma
3. You can use any generative LLM AI model for the analysis.
4. Document your code and provide explanations where necessary to showcase your thought process.

## Submission:

Please submit your solutions as a zip file or provide a link to a repository containing your code. Include any necessary instructions to run your code. Make sure to include the following:

- Source code for the front-end, back-end, and database design.
- Any additional instructions or documentation.
